	<p>Hello my name is Ahmad. I am a digital artist and I've been drawing seriously for about 3 years now. I am entirely self-taught, but that has not held me back. I have been blessed with maany opportunities to work with some amazing artists, get commissioned by some great people, and work or some video games as well. Thank you for stopping by my page and I can't wait to work with you!</p>
